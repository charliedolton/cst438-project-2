[**WISHLIST APP**](https://infinite-ravine-21110.herokuapp.com/)

This app is being created by Olisemedua Onwuatogwu, Osman Safi, Alejandro Ramirez, and Charlie Dolton.

This project will be a wishlist created using springboot.

We will design the database as well as the API the app uses. Intended functionality includes account creation and user login; creating, deleting, and editing a list; creating, deleting, and editing items; sharing a list via a link; and following another user. 

This is our initial wireframe:

And this is our initial ERD:

**Libraries used:**

[JSoup](https://jsoup.org/)

- "jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors."   
(from https://jsoup.org/)   

Jsoup was used to create the Amazon scraper which allows a user to add an automatically created item to their wishlist by just using an Amazon URL.

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers."
(from https://jquery.com/)
